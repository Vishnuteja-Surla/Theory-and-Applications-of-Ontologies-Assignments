# CS6852: Theory and Applications of Ontologies

This repository contains the assignments, code, ontology files, and supporting documents for the course **CS6852: Theory and Applications of Ontologies (Jul–Nov 2025, A Slot, Graduate Section – M.Tech/MS/PhD/Other students)**, offered by the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT Madras.

The repository is structured to reflect the theoretical understanding and practical application of ontology design, semantic web technologies, XML data frameworks, and reasoning techniques.

## Course Learning Objectives

By completing the assignments and projects in this repository, students will:

* **Theory:** Gain a strong foundation in Description Logics (DLs), including ALC, ALCN, SROIQ, SHIQ, and related inference methods.
* **Practice:** Apply DL semantics, reasoning, and ontology design techniques using OWL, Protégé, and semantic web tools.
* **Data Modeling:** Develop and query semi-structured data using XML, DTDs, XPath, and XQuery.
* **Knowledge Representation:** Build semantic models and ontologies in RDF/OWL and explore query languages such as SPARQL.
* **Application:** Integrate ontologies with real-world data, perform reasoning with OWLAPI/OWLReady, and infer new knowledge.
* **Critical Thinking:** Analyze limitations of ontology frameworks and propose justified design choices in practical settings.

## Course Content

Assignments span a subset of topics aligned with the course catalog, including:

* **Description Logics (DLs):** ALC, ALCN, SROIQ, SHIQ; semantics, DL rules, inference methods, bisimulation, tableaux algorithms.
* **Semi-structured Data and XML:** DTDs, XML Schema, XPath, XQuery; modeling and querying semi-structured data.
* **Semantic Models and Knowledge Bases:** RDF, RDF Schema, OWL, Protégé; SPARQL queries, Linked Data principles.
* **Applications of Ontologies:** Ontologies in static program analysis, simulation software synthesis, and problem-solving.

## Assignments Overview

### Assignment 1: Ontology Design (Group Task)

* Create an ontology/semantic model of a chosen domain using **Description Logic (SROIQ)**.
* Submission:

  * Domain description & knowledge items
  * DL Ontology (TBox)
  * Write-up with explanations, design decisions, motivating examples

---

### Assignment 2: XML Data Design (Group + Individual)

* **Group:** Create an XML DTD for the domain from Assignment 1 and populate with data.
* **Individual:** Write and run XPath/XQuery queries; submit English descriptions, queries, and results.
* Submission: DTD file, XML data, queries, and outputs.

---

### Assignment 3: Ontology Development (Group Task)

* Build an **OWL ontology** for the domain using **Protégé**.
* Ensure **consistency** before submission.
* Submission:

  * OWL file
  * Report PDF describing modifications, design choices, and comments

---

### Assignment 4: Inference using OWL (Individual Task)

* Develop a program that:

  * Extracts XML data (from Assignment 2) into RDF triples.
  * Integrates with OWL ontology (from Assignment 3).
  * Performs consistency checks and reasoning with OWLAPI/OWLReady.
  * Outputs extracted and inferred triples.
* Submission: Compressed folder with program, ontology, XML, RDF triples, and a README with execution instructions.
